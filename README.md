I learn Azure DevOps on Udemy and put my code here to remember. Code will smell, but who cares.

Udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/course/azure-devops-ci-cd-pipelines

Each technology will have a separate folder and branch (like dotnetcore, xamarin, node, etc)

# 'dotnetcore-webapp-ef-mssql'
Project includes CI/CD for dotnetcore, separate db migrations CI/CD for ef db (for DbContext you usually have in your solutions).
ToDo:
- Docker and Kubernetes CI/CD
- UI tests and deploy to prod
